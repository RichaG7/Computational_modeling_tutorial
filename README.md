# Computational_modeling_tutorial

#### Getting started
1. Install latest Python 3.x (not 2.x) using an Anaconda distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section. If you already have Anaconda on your computer (of any version), you can skip this step.
2. Create a Python 3.7 environment called something like 'comp_model' using the command listed on <a href='https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf'>this conda cheat sheet</a>.
3. Activate your environment, install the package manager PyPI in it using ```conda install pip```, and then use PyPI to install (at least) the following packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, jupyter. PyPI works in the following way: ```pip install <package_name> <package_name> <and so on...>```.
4. Create a clean folder for this tutorial, ```cd``` to the folder, and launch a Jupyter Notebook using the command ```jupyter notebook```.
5. Make a new 'sandbox' notebook and get comfortable with behavioral data analysis in Python by attempting to do the following things: 1) generate some random data in two variables of equal length and make a scatter plot using matplotlib; 2) generate some data for a linear relationship between two variables (e.g. age and height of schoolchildren), put them in a Pandas dataframe with 2 named columns, and use Seaborn to create a scatterplot with regression line; 3) create a Pandas dataframe with height data for 5 age groups and use Seaborn to turn this into a barplot with errorbars and an overlaid stripplot or swarmplot. Google is your friend!
